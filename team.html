          Harry was a graduate student in the Q-ACE Lab from 2023 to 2025. His research focused on machine learning-driven 
          optimization of spin readout in quantum dot devices. In particular, he explored the use of reinforcement learning 
          methods to redesign readout circuits and improve fidelity for silicon spin qubits. His work earned him the 2024 
          IMPACT Award from the American Physical Society&rsquo;s Group on Data Science, which recognizes graduate students who 
          &ldquo;have made noteworthy progress in their academic careers in the Data Science field.&rdquo; Harry graduated from the University 
          of Maryland in May 2025 with an M.S. in Physics.

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Danielle was the NIST Director&rsquo;s Postdoctoral Fellow in Q-ACE Lab at NIST from 2022 to 2023. Her reseach centered on developing fully
          automated methods for characterization, calibration, and control of semiconducting quantum dot devices, focusing on the first phase
          of the tuning process that brings the quantum dot device into an operational mode, the so-called &ldquo;bootstrapping&rdquo; or 
          &ldquo;cold-start tuning.&rdquo;

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Lisa was an NRC Postdoctoral Fellow in Q-ACE Lab at NIST from 2022 to 2023. Her research focused on integrating machine 
          learning techniques with physics-based heuristics and modeling to analyze data from cold atom experiments. She contributed 
          to developing methods for the automated detection of topological excitations &ndash; such as kink solitons and solitonic 
          vortices &ndash; in experimental images of Bose-Einstein condensates.

          Josh was an NRC Postdoctoral Fellow in Q-ACE Lab at NIST from 2020 to 2025. His research focused on developing machine-learning-driven 
          aproaches for charge tuning in quantum dot devcies. He also worked on enhancing QFlow &ndash; the in-hous build quantum dot simulation &ndash; 
          by incorporating synthetic noise typical of quantum dot experiments. Josh left NIST in 2022 to join Intel Corporation as a Quantum Computing 
          Research Scientist.
